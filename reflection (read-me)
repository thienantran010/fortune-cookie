I wanted experience manipulating the DOM and using APIs so I made this fortune cookie.

The hardest part of this project was creating the darkened background and pop-up message with the fortune. I first tried making it in JavaScript with appendChild()
and classList.add() but it was too tedious so I switched to just making it in HTML and CSS. However, that didn't work out so I found a great alternative - modals. I left
some of my past attempts in the code, commeneted out.

I used a lot of code from this tutorial to make the modal: https://sabe.io/tutorials/how-to-create-modal-popup-box and changed some parts. It worked out nicely.

The API gave me a little trouble. I kept getting undefined when printing the results to console, but apparently after you do response.json(), it gives you a slip
object with another slip object inside. To get the advice, you needed to do slip['slip]['advice'] instead of slip['advice'].

What I Learned:
DOM manipulation
Promises / fetch API / third party APIs

What I want to Learn next:
Use more complex APIs
Frameworks (REACT????)
